# 8 Week SQL Challenge

This repository contains my take on solutions to the 8 Week SQL Challenge.

It showcases my SQL expertise by working through practical, hands-on data scenarios, enhancing my ability to query, analyze, and manipulate data effectively. This allowed me to improve my problem-solving skills with SQL, strengthened my ability to extract actionable insights, and made me more proficient in managing complex datasets â€” valuable skills for data-driven decision-making and reporting in real-world applications.

I used MySQL to write the queries to solve the case studies.
